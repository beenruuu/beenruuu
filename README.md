👋 Hi! I'm **Rubén González Muñoz**, a web development student from **Spain** 🇪🇸.  
Currently studying **DAW (Web Application Development)**.  
Learning **Java**, **SQL**, and improving my understanding of **web technologies**.  

Still **Vibe Coding** with **React** and **Next.js** — exploring, building, breaking things, and learning as I go.

## 🌱 In Progress

- Learning the fundamentals with patience and curiosity.  
- Discovering how design and logic work together.  
- Experimenting with code that feels right and makes sense.

## 🧠 Philosophy

> Learning isn’t a race. It’s a journey with no shortcuts.
