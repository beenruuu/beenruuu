> *One step at a time. I'm becoming a developer. Iâ€™ll get there.*

Currently vibe coding with **React** and **Next.js**.  
Sometimes I mess around with **Python**, but still learning the ropes.  
Iâ€™m on my path â€” exploring, building, breaking things, improving.

## ðŸŒ± In Progress

- No rush. I'm here for the long game.
- Experimenting with ideas, visuals, and code that feels right.
- I care about what looks good, feels good, and flows.
